We present our participation as SINAI research group from the Universidad de Ja√©n at Task 3 "Consumer Health Search" specifically in sub-task 1 "Ad-hoc Search". We apply the query expansion technique using the most famous search engine at the moment: Google. Using the search engine, we will add additional information not previously included in the query. We will identify the medical concepts using cTAKES. This recognizer provides us with UMLS concepts in the expanded query. This way, we avoid introducing noise with words that are not related to the user query.
