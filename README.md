# CLEFeHealth2018IRtask
Official repository for the CLEF 2018 eHealth Lab, IR Task. 

This task is a continuation of the previous CLEF eHealth information retrieval (IR) tasks that ran in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and embraces the TREC-style evaluation process, with a shared collection of documents and queries, the contribution of runs from participants and the subsequent formation of relevance assessments and evaluation of the participants submissions.

This year's IR task will continue the growth path identified in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 CLEF eHealth information retrieval challenges. 

The 2018 task uses a new web corpus and a new set of queries compared to previous years.
